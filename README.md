Apache Stream Processing Frameworks
========

I do challenge anyone of you to name all different stream processing framework/platform/engines
available at the Apache Software Foundation (https://projects.apache.org/)

Tough question, right?

In order to have a bit more visibility out of this jungle, the 
[]Hacky Thursdays sessions from September to December 2016](http://daplab.ch/2016/08/29/hacky-thursdays-back-school-fall-2016/)
will follow the red line: **Streams Processing WTF?**

If you ever know the answer of this question, 
you’re more then welcome to contribute to one or another session :)

If, like me, you keep stacking articles about these technologies 
and you promised yourself in your new year resolutions to hack around, 
it’s not too late to achieve this goal.

In short, we’ll build a use case to try all of these technologies 
and compare them using requirements we’ll set in advance, 
such as ramp up time, ease of deploy, integration with YARN, debugging, performance, etc…

This project aims at centralizing the source code written and deployed at this occasion.
